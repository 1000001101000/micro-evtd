micro-evtd (3.3.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * debian/udeb/micro_evtd.command: Fixed test condition for whether daemon is
    already running. (Closes: #580549)

    microapl.  Based on a patch by Noriaki Mitsunaga. (Closes: #534257)

    actually copies and runs now.
  * debian/patches/script-paths.patch: Refreshed.
  * debian/init.d:
    - Replaced Required-{Start,Stop} with values from /etc/init.d/skeleton,
    as the daemon has no special requirements.  (Fixes a lintian error.)
    - Added runlevel 1 to Default-Stop.  (Fixes a lintian warning.)
  * debian/rules: Overrode CFLAGS to work around a segfault that appears when
    built with optimizations.
