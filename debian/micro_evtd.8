.SH DESCRIPTION

.IR micro_evtd
is a simple and small user space interface to the Linkstation/Kuro Micro
controller which is fitted to the ARM series of NAS boxes.  It doesn't
have a lot of features and its main task is to provide 'keep-alive'
messages to the on-board Micro.  This device controls/monitors the fan,
various LEDs, system temperature and two buttons.  This daemon provides
the necessary initialisation to the device and also monitors and controls
the fan depending on current temperature readings.  It also monitors a
power button (located at the front) and a reset button (located at the rear).
.LP
A new feature of this daemon is the ability to code standby events for single
or groups of days.  This allows the user to add any number of standby-on/off
events as required.  You can send a SIGHUP to the daemon to get it to report
the time remaining before entering standby.  Five minutes before standby, a
message is reported to all users.  A user can delay standby by five minutes
by sending a SIGCONT to the daemon.  Each successive SIGCONT adds another
five minutes.  Alternatively, a SIGINT will log a standby skip.  When the
timed event is reached, it will skip it for the next event.
