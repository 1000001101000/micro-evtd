To Do List for Linkstation/Kuro/Terastation Micro Event daemon
==============================================================

* SBIN_PREFIX support
  to allow installing into /usr/local/sbin (default), /usr/sbin or /sbin
  * daemon and event script still use fix path /usr/local
  * Makefile can already verify and install with different prefixes
    (currently support for /usr/sbin and /sbin is disabled to avoid inconsistencies)

* Check directory locations
  * always refer to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
  * use /tmp/micro_evtd to place temporary files to avoid collisions with other programs
  * event script belongs inside sbin folder, not inside /etc

* Review changes before release (always)
  * run tests on clean stock firmware, Freelink 1.0rev2 and Freelink "Debian Lenny"
    check that needed directories are available or created on them
