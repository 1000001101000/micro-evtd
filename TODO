To Do List for Linkstation/Kuro/Terastation Micro Event daemon
==============================================================

* SBIN_PREFIX support
  to allow installing into /usr/local/sbin (default), /usr/sbin or /sbin
  * daemon script uses fix path /usr/local
  * Makefile can already verify and install with different prefixes
    (currently support for /usr/sbin and /sbin is disabled to avoid inconsistencies)

* Check directory locations
  * always refer to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
  - use /tmp/micro_evtd to place temporary files to avoid collisions with other programs
    Linkstations have a ramdisk for /tmp, so sub-folders get lost
    And the ramdisk is the reason for the script copy, to avoid permanent disk accessa and allow the disk to sleep.
  * event script belongs inside sbin folder, not inside /etc
    event script copies itself to tmp folder; use $0 instead of fix path
    micro_evtd.c references event script too; no path and use PATH search, problems?
    or add new config item SBIN=/usr/local/sbin to /etc/micro_evtd.conf; very flexible, no recompilation necessary; default?

* Review changes before release (always)
  * run tests on clean stock firmware, Freelink 1.0rev2 and Freelink "Debian Lenny"
    check that needed directories are available or created on them

* Versioning
  * Add last committed svn revision to version.h (via Makefile)

* Install
  * RC links
    * Simple link ok, sufficient and complete?
      ln -s ../init.d/micro_evtd /etc/rcS.d/S70micro_evtd
    * On Debian also update-rc.d and invoke-rc.d could be used
      if [ -e '/etc/debian_version'] / if [ -x "`which invoke-rc.d 2>/dev/null`" ]; then
  * man pages
    Adopt man db update
    if [ -x "`which mandb 2>/dev/null`" ]; then

* Misc
	* Analyse and adopt changes from Debian package 3.3.3
	  casting.patch (already included)
	  conffile.patch (already included)
	  eventscript.patch (debian-specific, not important)
	  makefile.patch (debian-specific, not important)
	  microapl-bashisms.patch (important, needs testing)
	  micro_evtd-default-conf.patch (looks wrong, as there's no /etc/defaults file anymore)
	  pidfile.patch (interesting, needs analysis)
	  script-paths.patch (looks wrong, as Linkstations use ramdisk for /tmp, so sub-folders get lost on reboot)
