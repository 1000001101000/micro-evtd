To Do List
==============================================================

update readme to reflect current functionality/purpose
set new version number and title
adjust program flow to parse all arguments before connecting
//simplify makefile to reflect current codebase
//add make target for static binary // there already was one...lol
investigate ways to generate binaries for ancient kernels (2.4.17)
add option to specify serial device, needs program flow adjustment
//investigate an auto-detect function for serial device
//rework program flow to remove goto statements
rework program flow to minimize global vars
//add logic to set return code on various failures. ** just com failure for now
//look at creating debug logic to print raw messages 
add support for micon V1 in addition to current micon V2, also needs flow  adjustment
investigate logic to support alternate OS (FreeBSD/NetBSD/Windows)
//FreeBSD will compile with minor changes but doesn't work.
//hangs trying to open port, seems like configuring port not working 

generally ensure code works with kernels 2.4 -> 5.8+ on armv5/armv7/PowerPC/mips/amd64
