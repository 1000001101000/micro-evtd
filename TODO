To Do List
==============================================================

update readme to reflect current functionality/purpose
set new version number and title
simplify makefile to reflect current codebase
add make target for static binary
investigate ways to generate binaries for ancient kernels (2.4.17)
add option to specify serial device
investigate an auto-detect function for serial device
rework program flow to remove goto statements
rework program flow to minimize global vars
add logic to set return code on various failures.
look at creating debug logic to print raw messages 
add support for micon V1 in addition to current micon V2
investigate logic to support alternate OS (FreeBSD/NetBSD/Windows)

generally ensure code works with kernels 2.4 -> 5.8+ on armv5/armv7/PowerPC/mips/amd64
