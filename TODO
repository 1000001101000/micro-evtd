To Do List for Linkstation/Kuro/Terastation Micro Event daemon
==============================================================

* Release
  ETA for beta: CW 26/2010 ("forum preview")
  ETA for release: CW 28/2010 (some weeks before next Debian freeze)

* Config file:
  * Only read by micro-evtd.c. Event script is only called by micro-evtd.
  * What happens when it is empty? First analysis shows defaults are used.
  * How should a sample file be named? micro-evtd.sample?
  * How should the real config file be named? /etc/micro-evtd.conf? /etc/micro-evtd?
  * Where should a sample file be kept? /etc/defaults/....?
    Keep extra /etc/micro-evtd/ folder to store sample file and real config file?
  * Shouldn't it be in /usr/local/etc/ ?

* InitRD:
  * update for further alpha testing
  * "<TMP>/in_standby" comes from /linuxrc of initrd
    renamed to "micro-evtd.in_standby", adopt /linuxrc accordingly
  * create target to help update an initrd

* Install target:
  * RC links
    * Simple link ok, sufficient and complete?
      ln -s ../init.d/micro-evtd /etc/rcS.d/S70micro-evtd
    * On Debian also update-rc.d and invoke-rc.d could be used
      if [ -e '/etc/debian_version'] / if [ -x "`which invoke-rc.d 2>/dev/null`" ]; then
  * man pages
    Adopt man db update
    if [ -x "`which mandb 2>/dev/null`" ]; then
  * Add target to update InitRd if /initrd exists in install path

* Review changes before release (always)
  * always refer to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
  * run tests on clean stock firmware, Freelink 1.0rev2 and Freelink "Debian Lenny"
    check that needed directories are available or created on them

* New features
  * Options to disable the sleep functionality and the script copy.
    As not all targets/distros have initrd support. (Ryan Tandy)
    Provide run-time(!) option to have one executable for all. Manageable? (Maddes)
      micro-evtd.conf: SCRIPT_COPY=1; 0 would set a new var strScriptPath to "",
                       otherwise it contains a copy of strTmpPath;
  * Autoconf support. (Ryan Tandy)
    Not required anymore as fixed pathes have been eliminated a lot.
    But could help distros to adopt to their filesystem scheme. (Maddes)



Done:
=====
+ Versioning
  + Add last committed svn revision to version.h (via Makefile)

- Create correct tgz files for man pages via Makefile and place correctly with "install" target
  Not necessary, distributions can also handle this if wanted.

+ SBIN_PREFIX support
  to allow installing into /usr/local/sbin (default), /usr/sbin or /sbin
  + daemon script uses fix path /usr/local
    micro-evtd.init(34): which ${DAEMON}
  + Makefile can already verify and install with different prefixes
    support for /usr/sbin and /sbin enabled
  + event script belongs inside sbin folder, not inside /etc
    event script copies itself to tmp folder; use $0 instead of fix path
    micro-evtd.event(58): which micro-evtd.event
  + micro-evtd.c references event script too; no path and use PATH search, problems?
    micro-evtd.c(607): let path find it
  - or add new config item SBIN=/usr/local/sbin to /etc/micro-evtd.conf; very flexible, no recompilation necessary; default?

- use /tmp/micro-evtd/ to place temporary files to avoid collisions with other programs
  Linkstations have a ramdisk for /tmp, so sub-folders get lost
  And the ramdisk is the reason for the script copy, to avoid permanent disk access and allow the disk to sleep.

+ Analyse and adopt changes from Debian package 3.3.3
  - eventscript.patch (debian-specific, not important)
  - makefile.patch (debian-specific, not important)
  - micro_evtd-default-conf.patch (looks wrong, as there's no /etc/defaults file anymore)
  - script-paths.patch (looks wrong, as Linkstations use ramdisk for /tmp, so sub-folders get lost on reboot)
  all other patches have been added to repository

+ File name cleanup:
  + general rename from "micro_evtd" (underscore) to "micro-evtd"
  + files in /boot are not renamed to be compatible with old versions of initrd
    /boot/pending_standby

+ Uninstall target:
  + should clean up all old stuff (or use additional target "removeold")
