Fork of the original tool for interfacing with the on-board microcontroller on the early linkstations. The original is still included as part of the installation for the LS-GL Debian Installer.

This version includes a few tweaks/fixes to allow the longer commands used to contol LCD displays to function properly. 

Information about the messages that can be used can be found here:

There is also a Python3 library for operating this interface:
