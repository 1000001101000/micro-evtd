Fork of the original tool for interfacing with the on-board microcontroller on the early linkstations. The original is still included as part of the installation for the LS-GL Debian Installer.

This version includes a few tweaks/fixes to allow the longer commands used to contol LCD displays to function properly.

See bins/ folder for pre-built binaries for each platform.

Information about the messages that can be used can be found here:

There is also a Python3 library for operating this interface:
https://github.com/1000001101000/Python_buffalo_libmicon

Usage Examples:

Send the "boot_end" signal which tells the mcu that the device booted successfully (and not to restart)
micro-evtd -s 0003

Set a message on the LCD screen:
micro-evtd -s 20905465726173746174696f6e2061726d2044656269616e20496e7374616c6c657231

On Newer devices the sytnax is:
micro-evtd -s3 "BOOT_END"

micro-evtd -s3 "LCD_PUTS 0 Terastation x86","LCD_PUTS 1 Debian Installer"

I've tested it on armel,armhf,PowerPC and amd64 based Linkstation/Terastations 

So far I've mainly tested it under Debian Linux but it should work on any Linux distro if you compile it against that version's libc/etc.

You can also build with the "static " option to create a larger binary which will work accross different distros/versions. If you're looking to run it under a really old distro/firmware (kernel 2.4 based) you'll need to build it against libraries old enough to support that.
